# projects_CV
Folder containing several mini projects done with the knowledege acquired so far. <br>
Some of the images of the projects are below, and in the main page there are the links for each of the projects. <br>
These mini projects are intended to show what I've learned so far and also to cement everything all this knowledge. 
The design of the pages wasn't the priority, I focused on JS code on the majority of the projects for cementing the knowledge of it.
